Solr-PHP-Example
================

This is a simple example of how to use Solr in your PHP project.

In this example we fill the index (generate.php) with an RSS feed from http://www.rottentomatoes.com that you can then perform queries on
using the index.php.

If you want to remove the data from the index, you can simply call clear.php and the index is empty.

We use the default schema of Solr and depend on a Solr server running on localhost.
